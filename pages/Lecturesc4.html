    For all students:<br>
    
    Fill out this google form, which asks you to decide whether you want to participate in the course sychronously, or asychronously, and also provides me with some background info to help pair you with a journal partner.<br>
    
    Review the syllabus, and text (203.240.0726) or email me (lockwoodh1@southernct.edu) if you have questions.<br>
    
    Take a look at the Useful News Resources page, and think about signing up for tech news from either your favorite media sources, or from one of the sources on this list of “best tech newsletters.”
    
    <br>For asynchronous students:<br>
    
    Optional: If you are available on either Tuesday or Thursday at 11:00 and want to drop into the Teams meeting to meet myself, the T.A., and other students, please do so. This is not required, so don’t stress if you’re not available!</p>
