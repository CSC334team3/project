                                Office hours and scheduled meetings are held through my virtual office Zoom link<br>
My office hours are usually open, meaning that multiple students can be in my office (or virtual office) at the same time. I find it very useful for students to listen to each others questions related to course material. If you want to discuss something other than course material, or if you prefer to ask your course material related question in private, please let me know and I can accomodate you.
